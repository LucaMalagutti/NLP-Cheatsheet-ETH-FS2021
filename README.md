# NLP Cheat sheet


This repository contains my handwritten cheat sheet for the spring 2021 Natural Language Processing exam at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The summary is mainly based on the lecture slides, but also on the exercises of the course and on [this more extensive summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVvjEiYvkggJOjTZxi5hhoxDIIgPyLFG/view) by Niklas Stoehr.

It is provided 'as is' without warranties of any kind.
